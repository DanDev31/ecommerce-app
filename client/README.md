Hi there!

This is the first version of a basic e-commerce application, which is based on pc gamer products. I was built it with React, Redux Toolkit and Redux-Persist, Node Js, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Styled Components. It also includes some useful tools like JWT, Crypto Js, Stripe and Passport Js for Google Authentication.

You can go through and search, filter, add, delete and buy products.

Any recommendation or advice is always welcome!
